# Bug #8: Dead Code Comment Indicating Removed Functionality

## Severity
**Low** - Code cleanliness issue, doesn't affect functionality but reduces code clarity.

## Description
There is a comment in the code stating "Custom components have been removed from this implementation" without any associated code. This is a dead code comment that provides no value and should be removed for code cleanliness.

## Location
File: `src/apps/faceplate-builder/FaceplateBuilderApp.vue`
Line: 1262

## Code
```typescript
// Line 1260
}

// Custom components have been removed from this implementation

function handleBeforeUnload(event: BeforeUnloadEvent) {
```

## Problem
This comment appears between function definitions without any context or associated code. It suggests that custom component functionality was previously present but has been removed, leaving behind only this orphaned comment.

Comments like this:
- Add no value to understanding the current code
- Can confuse future developers
- Clutter the codebase
- Make the code look unfinished or poorly maintained

## Expected Behavior
If custom components were removed, the comment should also be removed. If the comment serves as documentation for future reference, it should be more detailed and explain:
- What was removed
- Why it was removed  
- Where to find more information
- Whether it might be added back in the future

## Suggested Fix
Simply remove the comment:

```typescript
}

function handleBeforeUnload(event: BeforeUnloadEvent) {
```

## Alternative Fix (If Comment is Needed)
If the comment serves a purpose, make it more informative:

```typescript
}

/**
 * Note: Custom component functionality was removed from this version.
 * The builder now only supports built-in primitive components.
 * Custom components may be re-added in a future version.
 * See issue #XXX for more information.
 */

function handleBeforeUnload(event: BeforeUnloadEvent) {
```

## Impact
- **Low**: Does not affect functionality
- Makes code look less polished
- Can confuse developers reading the code
- Takes up unnecessary lines

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open `src/apps/faceplate-builder/FaceplateBuilderApp.vue`
2. Navigate to line 1262
3. Observe the orphaned comment

## Related Files

## Notes
- This is a code quality/cleanliness issue
- The fix is trivial (delete one line)
- Good practice is to remove dead code and comments when refactoring
- Version control (git) maintains history of removed code, so there's no need to leave comments about what was deleted
